### CIFAR-10 Image Classification
This repository provides a solution for the CIFAR-10 image classification task. CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for computer vision, consisting of 60,000 images (32x32 pixels) across 10 classes, including airplanes, cars, cats, dogs, and more.

### Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for classifying CIFAR-10 images using PyTorch.

### Technologies Used
Python 3.8+
PyTorch and torchvision for deep learning
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
Numpy for data manipulation
